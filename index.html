	<p>In <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/analysis_and_planning/domestic-violence/dv-local-law-38-annual-2021.pdf">2021</a>, the New York City Police Department registered more than 80 thousand domestic violence complaints. However, for The Bronx and certain parts of Brooklyn, the numbers are much higher than for the rest of the city.</p>

<p>According to Joshiana Guaman, member of <a href="https://sanctuaryforfamilies.org/gender-violence/domestic-violence/">Sanctuary for Families</a>, dedicated to helping domestic violence victims, the statistics do not meet the magnitude of the reality, because many victims do not accuse their abusers immediately.</p> 

<p>“It's really hard and alarming to be able to understand, in reality, how many people are affected and never get out of the cycle, but the people that try and do is a really high amount of numbers”, she pointed out to add that lack of education and support are part of the reasons for many to delay their search for help.</p> 

<p>More than half of The Bronx’s precincts appear among the 10 precincts with the most cases. A <a href="https://newdestinyhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/bronx-ipv-report.pdf">report</a> attributes these numbers mostly to poverty. About 30% of the population in this county lives under the poverty levels, according to <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/boroughs/bronx-population">World Population Review</a>.</p>
